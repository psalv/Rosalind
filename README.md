Biology based computing problems.

Various questions from Rosalind.com to explore using computation to solve biological problems.
One file of particular interest is SEQUENCE.py, in which a series of useful fucntions related to DNA and protein
sequences have been compiled into classes, making working with data from FASTA files simple.
